AI-Powered Smart Food Recommendation System

Overview
This project is an AI-powered food recommendation system designed to enhance user experience by providing personalized meal suggestions based on ingredient similarity and user preferences. The system utilizes machine learning techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze recipes and suggest the most relevant dishes.
 
 Objectives
•	Develop a custom ML model for personalized food recommendations.
•	Utilize real-world datasets for training and validation.
•	Incorporate contextual factors like user preferences, dietary restrictions, and ingredient similarity.
•	Optimize for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

Dataset Used
We used the Food.com Recipes and User Interactions dataset, which includes:
	 Recipes with ingredients, names, and descriptions.
	User interactions (ratings & reviews for different recipes).
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions

Technologies Used
	Python 
	Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
	Scikit-Learn (ML Model - TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity)
	Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
	Google Colab (Development & Testing)
Features
	Personalized Food Recommendations 
	Ingredient-Based Similarity Matching 
	Scalable and Fast 
 Easy Integration into Chatbots & Apps 
 
 Model Development Process
 
1.Data Preprocessing
•	Cleaned text data (ingredients & recipes).
•	Converted ingredient lists into TF-IDF vectors.

2️. Model Training
•	Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to extract keyword importance.
•	Used Cosine Similarity to find closely related recipes.

3️. Recommendation System
•	When a user selects a recipe, the system finds 5 most similar dishes.
•	Similarity is based on ingredients & recipe descriptions.

Model Performance & Results
 Accuracy: High similarity in recommended recipes.
 Efficiency: Quick computation with TF-IDF vectorization.
 User Satisfaction: Provides meaningful and personalized recommendations.
Future Improvements
	Incorporate User Ratings (Collaborative Filtering).
	Consider Context (Weather, Diet, Mood).
	Develop Web App or Chatbot Integration.
 
Conclusion
This AI-powered food recommendation system provides smart meal suggestions based on ingredient similarity, making it easier for users to discover new and exciting recipes. The model is fast, scalable, and can be integrated into real-world applications such as food apps, chatbots, and smart assistants.
